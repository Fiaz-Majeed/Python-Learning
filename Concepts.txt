1. Data types:
	a. Primitives = single value stored- string, integer, Boolean, float6
	b. Non-primitives = multiple values
2. Variable phases: declaration , initialization
3. Errors: Syntax, logical, run-time
4. mypie in python provides logical error at compile time.
5. Variable: explicit (provide type)-best practice, non- explicit (do not provide type but detect based on value)
6. ipynb (interactive python notebook)-runs the code in chunks
7. List: store multiple values at consecutive memory locations.
	positive indexing = 0, 1, 2, ..., Reverse indexing = -4, -3, -2, -1
	Slicing: extract a part from the list.
8. Copy() function copies list at different memory locations.
